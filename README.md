# Algorithms and data structures

This repository was created for useful materials, links, problem solutions about algorithms and data structures.
The author found out that he has a big gap in education about basic computer science stuff and decide to fulfill it.

Now it is more like a set of raw materials and I create it for my own usage, hope later it will be more organized and helpful for other people.
I also use [Golang](https://golang.org/) for everything to learn it.

## Lectures
1. Yandex Data School. Algorithms and data structures. Part 1. You can find my **raw** notes [here](YDS/Lecture_Raw_Notes.md).

## Algorithms and exercises.
1. In [hackerrank directory](hackerrank) you can find my solutions for hackerrank problems using Go.
2. In [YDS/exercises](YDS/exercises) solutions to course-related problems.
